[^1]: This lead screw is a 400mm T8 ACME thread single (1) start with a 2mm pitch & lead. It also has a T8 Anti-backlash spring loaded Nut. As well as a royal duck load of cheap WD-40 Whit lithium grease in the z-stepper motor. MLG maneuver right there. 

[^2]: I am not an expert at firmware building. Although i may have experience in programming. I can assure you that i make mistakes. Sometimes more than i care to admit.

[^3]: This does not include a list of all changes. This is just incase i make a boo boo. Instead of looking back through weeks of version history, this serves as an easy way to see where my boo boo may have taken place.
